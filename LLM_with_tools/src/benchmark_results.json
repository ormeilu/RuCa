We need to find cheap wireless headphones under 1000 rubles and convert price to dollars. We need to search products. We have tool search_products. We can call search_products with query \"беспроводные наушники\" and maybe category \"audio\" or \"headphones\". We also need to convert price to dollars. We have tool currency_converter. So we need to call search_products first, then for each product, convert price. But we can only call one tool at a time. The instructions: \"You can call tools sequentially. After getting result of tool you can call next tool if necessary.\" So we need to first call search_products. Then after we get results, we need to call currency_converter for each product? But we can only call one tool at a time. We can call search_products, get results. Then we need to produce final answer. But we cannot produce final answer until we have converted prices. We could call currency_converter for each product. But we might need to call it multiple times. But the instructions: \"You can call tools sequentially. After receiving result of tool you can call next tool if necessary.\" So we can call search_products, then call currency_converter for each product. But we need to produce final answer. But we cannot produce final answer until we have all conversions. But we can call multiple times. But we need to produce JSON each time. The system might handle multiple calls. But we need to produce a single JSON output. The instructions: \"If you can call tool, call. 'tool_call.called': true.\" So we need to call search_products. Then we need to call currency_converter. But we cannot call two tools in one JSON. We can only call one tool per response. So we need to first call search_products. Then after we get results, we can call currency_converter. But we need to produce final answer. But the user wants the list of headphones under 1000 rubles and their price in dollars. We can do it in one step: search_products with query \"беспроводные наушники\" and maybe filter by max_price 1000. Then we get results. Then we need to convert each price to dollars. We can call currency_converter for each product. But we can also do it in one step by calling search_products and then converting. But we cannot do conversion inside search_products. So we need to call search_products first. Then we need to call currency_converter for each product. But we can only call one tool at a time. So we need to call search_products, then call currency_converter for the first product, then maybe call again for next product. But we need to produce final answer. But the instructions: \"You can call tools sequentially. After receiving result of tool you can call next tool if necessary.\" So we can produce multiple responses. But the user expects a single answer. But we can do it step by step: first call search_products, then after we get results, we call currency_converter for each product. But we need to produce final answer. But we can produce final answer after all conversions. But we need to produce JSON each time. The system might handle multiple calls. But we need to produce a single JSON output. The instructions: \"If you can call tool, call. 'tool_call.called': true.\" So we need to call search_products. Then we need to call currency_converter. But we cannot call both at once. So we need to call search_products first. Then we need to call currency_converter for each product. But we need to produce final answer. But we can produce final answer after all conversions. But we need to produce JSON each time. But the user might not want multiple responses. But the system might handle multiple calls. But we need to produce a single JSON. The instructions: \"You can call tools sequentially. After receiving result of tool you can call next tool if necessary.\" So we can produce a JSON with tool_call called search_products. Then we get results. Then we produce another JSON with tool_call called currency_converter. But we need to produce final answer. But the user might want the final answer. But we can produce final answer after all conversions. But we need to produce final answer in JSON. But we cannot produce text outside JSON. So we need to produce final answer in JSON. But we need to include the list of headphones and their price in dollars. But we cannot produce text outside JSON. So we need to produce JSON with the list. But the structure of JSON is fixed: we must have \"id\", \"tool_call\", \"clarification_question\", \"user_message\", \"internal\". The \"tool_call\" can be null if we are not calling a tool. But we can also include \"tool_call\" with \"called\": false. But we need to produce final answer. But the instructions: \"If you can call tool, call.
